Michael Jordan: Just fine.  How are you doing?

ED: Real good.  College player of the year amongst so many other honors, picked 3rd in the NBA draft by the Chicago Bulls.  You’ll be getting a chance to see close up Enos Whatley and Wiggins and the rest of those fellas.  How do you think you will fit there?

Michael Jordan: Well hopefully I fit pretty well.  I’m looking forward to it.  I played with Enos when I came out of high school so I’m looking forward to playing with him again.

ED: Alright, at 6’6″ 195lbs actually you could play two positions.  Which would you prefer?

Michael Jordan: It doesn’t matter really.  Whatever can contribute to the team.  If I have to play small forward, if I have to play guard whatever the team needs.

ED: Some of the people who know this game best say that perhaps you’re going to be a beautiful big guard.  How do you feel about that?

Michael Jordan: Well hopefully that becomes true.  I’m not looking forward to going in and trying to live up to everyone else’s expectations.  I just want to go in and contribute the best way I could and I just look forward to whatever the coaches want.

ED: Do you know anything about Kevin Loughery’s style of coaching and what he wants from his players?

Michael Jordan: Not really.  I’m looking forward to meeting coach Loughery and looking forward to his coaching ability

ED: Well Michael, you’ve got a great opportunity to step in there and win a city that is crying for a winner.  That is a fabulous sports town in Chicago and with a little help from a fellow named Michael Jordan perhaps you can turn that Bulls thing around.  What do you think?

Michael Jordan: Hopefully I can go in and contribute and maybe turn it around.  I’m looking forward to that.

ED: Well Michael, we want to wish you the best.  I know that Olympic team is shaping up and I can’t wait to see you next year in the NBA

Michael Jordan: Thank you very much
